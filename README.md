# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of employees who are preparing to retire, in addition, to determine how many of these retiring employees will be eligible to participate in the company’s mentorship program. Using the PostgreSQL pgAdmin database we were able to write and execute queries that created the following:

•	“Retirement Titles” table for employees born January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955.
•	“Unique Titles” table that contains: the employee number, first and last names, and most recent title. 
•	“Retiring Titles” table that contains the number of job titles filled by employees who are retiring.
•	“Mentorship Eligibility” table for current employees who were born between January 1, 1965, and December 31, 1965. 

**Results

•	We were able to determine the number of employees who were about to retire in a couple of years: (a count of 90,398 employees).
•	The number of employees to retire can be grouped by their current title (i.e., the number of Senior Engineer employees to retire is 29,414 compared to 2 employees who are Managers)
•	The number of employees who were eligible for mentorship program is 1550 
•	According to the data, most of the employees at this company at retirement age mostly held senior titles.

**Summary


The data obtained from this analysis helps the company plan and prepare in regard to the terms of employee retirement packages, promotions, new hire and training. The company can strategically develop and implement a plan that will be effective and sustainable addressing workforce staffing ambiguity as follows:
1.	How many upcoming vacant positions need to be filled?
2.	Which employees within the company need to be promoted/trained for new open titles?
Lastly, to help the company minimize the impact of upcoming retirements, an additional query could be created and executed to determine the departments with the eldest individuals within the company and see how best to prioritize and implement the mentorship program.
